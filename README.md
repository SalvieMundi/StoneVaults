# Stonevaults

Stonevaults is a Fabric mod that adds unfriendly jigsaw structures.

# Requirements

Stonevaults depends on **[Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)** and **[Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config).**

# Technical Info

All structures present in this mod are jigsaw structures that make use of template pools and processors as well as structure files. There isn't a ton of easy to understand information about creating jigsaw structures but [TelepathicGrunt's StructureTutorialMod](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/StructureTutorialMod) is very helpful for understanding how they work.
